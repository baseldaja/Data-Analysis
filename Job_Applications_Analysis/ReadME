Data Cleaning Process README
Overview
This README provides an overview of the data cleaning process for the "Clean_Data" dataset.
The dataset contains information about how was cleaned to prepare it for analysis or further use.

Data Sources
Original Data: Kaggle-Job_applications
Data Cleaning Steps
The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure that the dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. Below are the main data cleaning steps performed:

Loading the Data: The original dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

Handling Missing Values:

Identified columns with missing values.
Filled missing values in specific columns with appropriate strategies (mode, mean, or 'other').
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows, if any, were identified and removed from the dataset. (if needed)

Data Type Conversion: Ensured that data types for each column were appropriate (converting dates to datetime objects). (if needed)

Data Validation:

Checked for unrealistic or incorrect values in numeric columns.
Verified that categorical columns contained valid categories.

Saving the Cleaned Data:

The cleaned dataset was saved to a CSV file named "Clean_Data.csv" in the "Data_CSV" folder.
Usage

The cleaned dataset, "Clean_Data.csv," can now be used for data analysis, modeling, or any other data-related tasks. To utilize the cleaned data, follow these steps:

Load the Cleaned Data: Use a programming language like Python and libraries such as Pandas to load the "Clean_Data.csv" file into a DataFrame.

Data Analysis: Perform your desired data analysis, visualization, or modeling tasks on the cleaned dataset.
